> It sounds like the default mode should be switched to “event1” based on your results. There was some discussion on the [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/xrje84/firemote_is_now_available_through_hacs/) comments about this when I first added support, but perhaps those discussions mislead me to set “event5” as the default. I’m probably going to need your help to pull specific commands for the cube’s Power and Center buttons to ensure that all buttons will work properly under “event1”
